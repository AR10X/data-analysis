1. Give the count of the minimum number of days for the time when temperature reduced

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT Date, Temperature, 
             LAG(Temperature) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS prev_temp
      FROM weather_dataset_v2) t
WHERE temperature < prev_temp;

1829

2. Find the temperature as Cold / hot by using the case and avg of values of the given data set


SELECT
    Date,
    Temperature,
    AVG(Temperature) OVER() AS avg_temp,
    (CASE 
        WHEN Temperature >= AVG(Temperature) OVER() THEN 'Hot'
        ELSE 'Cold'
     END) AS temp_label
FROM 
    weather_dataset_v2;

______________________________________________________________________________________________________


3.   Can you check for all 4 consecutive days when the temperature was below 30 Fahrenheit

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t1 SELECT Date, Temperature,
         SUM(CASE WHEN Temperature < 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
           OVER (ORDER BY Date ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS below_30_count
  FROM weather_dataset_v2;
  SELECT date, temperature FROM t1 WHERE below_30_count = 4;

4.  Can you find the maximum number of days for which temperature dropped


WITH weather_data_temp AS (
  SELECT 
    Date, 
    Temperature, 
    LAG(Temperature, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Date) AS prev_temp 
  FROM weather_dataset_v2
) 
SELECT 
  Date, 
  Temperature, 
  prev_temp, 
  CASE 
    WHEN prev_temp <= Temperature THEN 0
    ELSE 1 
  END AS drop_temp_indicator, 
  SUM(CASE 
    WHEN prev_temp <= Temperature THEN 0
    ELSE 1 
  END) 
    OVER (ORDER BY Date 
          ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
  AS drop_temp_count 
FROM weather_data_temp 
ORDER BY Date;

5.  Can you find the average of average humidity from the dataset

select avg(avg_humidity) as avg_of_avg_hum
from
(select Date,avg(`Average humidity (%)`) as avg_humidity
	from weather_dataset_v2
    group by Date) as derivedtable;

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

6. Use the GROUP BY clause on the Date column and make a query to fetch details for average windspeed ( which is now windspeed done in task 3 ) ( NOTE: should contain the following clauses: group by, order by, date )

SELECT
    Date, `Average windspeed (mph)` AS avg_wind_speed
FROM
    weather_dataset_v2
GROUP BY Date,`Average windspeed (mph)`
LIMIT 25;

7. Please add the data in the dataset for 2034 and 2035 as well as forecast predictions for these years




______________________________________________________________________________________________________

8. If the maximum gust speed increases from 55mph, fetch the details for the next 4 days ( NOTE: data consistency and uniformity should be maintained )

SELECT 
  Date, 
  Temperature, 
  `Average humidity (%)`, 
  `Average dewpoint (Â°F)`, 
  `Average barometer (in)`, 
  `Average windspeed (mph)`, 
  `Average gustspeed (mph)`, 
  `Average direction (Â°deg)`, 
  `Rainfall for month (in)`, 
  `Rainfall for year (in)`, 
  `Maximum rain per minute`, 
  `Maximum temperature (Â°F)`, 
  `Minimum temperature (Â°F)`, 
  `Maximum humidity (%)`, 
  `Minimum humidity (%)`, 
  `Maximum pressure`, 
  `Minimum pressure`, 
  `Maximum windspeed (mph)`, 
  `Maximum gust speed (mph)`, 
  `Maximum heat index (Â°F)`, 
  Month, 
  diff_pressure
FROM weather_dataset_v2
WHERE 
  Date >= (
    SELECT MIN(Date) 
    FROM weather_dataset_v2 
    WHERE `Maximum gust speed (mph)` >= 55
  ) 
  AND Date <= (
    SELECT MIN(Date) + INTERVAL 4 DAY 
    FROM weather_dataset_v2 
    WHERE `Maximum gust speed (mph)` >= 55
  )
ORDER BY 
  Date;

9. Find the number of days when the temperature went below 0 degrees Celsius

Select count(Date)
from(select Date,Temperature
	from weather_dataset_v2
    where Temperature<0) as dp;

14

10. Create another table with a “Foreign key” relation with the existing given data set.

alter table weather_dataset_v2
add column id int Auto_increment primary key first;
create table weatherapp(
id int auto_increment primary key
dataID int NOT NULL,
foreign key (dataID) references weather_dataset_v2(id)
