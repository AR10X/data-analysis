Weather Forecasting Analysis and Visualization Project

About the Project

This project is aimed at providing insights and visual representations of various weather patterns and trends, by analyzing and comparing weather data of different cities and regions across the world. The project uses various data analysis and visualization tools to help users understand the weather patterns and trends in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

Project Description

The project makes use of various data sources to gather weather information such as temperature, precipitation, pressure, and other important meteorological data. This data is then processed and analyzed using various data analysis and visualization tools such as SQL, Excel, Power BI/ Tableau and Python. The results of this analysis are then presented to the users through interactive visualizations and graphs, making it easier for them to understand and analyze weather trends and patterns.

Tech Used

The following tools and technologies are used in the project:

SQL (MYSQL): Used for managing and storing the large amounts of weather data that is collected for the analysis.

Power BI/ Tableau: Used for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards, charts and graphs that present the results of the weather data analysis.

Excel: Used for performing basic data analysis and manipulation tasks such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.

Python: Used for developing custom scripts and algorithms that are used to process and analyze the weather data. The project also makes use of various Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization purposes.
